            <h1>What is ASIV?</h1>
            <hr color="#ffc40d">
            <p>ASIV is the short-hand acronym for our Autonomous Subway Inspection Vehicle. The ASIV is a small scale autonomous robot that looks to lower the expensive vehicles and larger inspection crews previously needed to safely inspect subway systems.</p>
            
            <p class="last-para">Our ASIV autonomously measures critical track geometry, with an emphasis on track gauge. The vehicle is designed to live on the tracks, recharging when necessary and retracting using our proprietary design to fold in its wheels, detatch off the rails and lower itself in between the tracks. After the train passes, the ASIV extends itself back onto the track and continues its inspection.</p>

          <h1>Why do we need to innovate?</h1>
          <hr color="#ffc40d">
          <p class="last-para">A 2017 study shows that 20 minutes of delays cost New Yorkers $400 million in lost productivity. In the past 3 years, the MTA has spent over $2 billion on track maintenance alone in order to alleviate the damages caused by track defects. ASIV would help in reducing these delays and costs by enhancing the MTA's ability to spot and repair track defects early in their development and with a higher rate than currently possible. This way, issues will be quickly addressed before they become more complex, expensive, and hazardous.</p>

          <p>The New York City subway is the busiest metro service in the United States.</p>
          <p>Annual ridership surpassed 1.68 billion in 2018 and daily passengers exceed 5.6 million.</p>

          <h1>Current Market Analysis</h1>
          <hr color="#ffc40d">
          <p>New York City's MTA currently has four track geometry inspection vehicles, which are train cars outfitted with sensors and cameras. Each vehicle costs $2.5 million to buy and must still be manned by a crew of 6, accruing variable labor costs.</p>
          
          <p class="last-para">Besides track geometry cars, most inspects are done by hand with specialized tools, however these also create liability costs in keeping with safety standards on the rail. The ASIV positions itself as a cheaper alternative to puncture into the railroad inspection industry market.</p>

        <h1>How much will this cost?</h1>
        <hr color="#ffc40d">
        <p>We look to sell and lease units to railways and offer inspection services.</p>
        
        <p>Units are currently priced at $15,000. Customers could also lease the vehicle and use our consultants for $750 per mile, per month.</p> 
        
        <p class="last-para">We plan to expand from our initial focus of NYC to target the top 10 subway systems in the United States, which account for 1200 miles of track.</p>
